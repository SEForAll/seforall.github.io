# Research

The goal of SEFL team is to integrate security education into programming courses. To do so, we find new ways to use tools in programming courses in a plug-and-play manner. We also find novel ways to teach security concepts.
We are interested in all programming courses: Beginner, Intermediate, and, Advanced.

We strongly believe in diversity and aim to be a diverse group with members from different backgrounds.

Here are some themes and techniques that we currently work on:

**Fuzzing : New Frontiers**. We explore different techniques to help the fuzzing techniques to test programs effectively. We have exciting ideas in this direction. Get in touch to know more.

**Static Analysis : Best-effort techniques**. We develop new/modify existing/configure existing static analysis techniques to be used effectively in programming courses. 

### ... and more.
